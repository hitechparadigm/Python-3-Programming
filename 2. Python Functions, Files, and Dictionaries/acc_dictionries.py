# Write a program that finds the key in a dictionary that has the maximum value. If two keys have the same maximum value, itâ€™s OK to print out either one. Fill in the skeleton code

# 1. Create a dictionary called d that keeps track of all the characters in the string placement and notes how many times each character was seen. Then, find the key with the lowest value in this dictionary and assign that key to min_value.
